What was good and should be recognized
OOP - principles: encapsulation and polymorphism: named and described the principles, gave an example
Java Fundamentals. Collections: named the collections interfaces he worked with: List, Map, Set, few realization examples.
Java Fundamentals. Exceptions: named main exceptions hierarchy. Checked and Unchecked exceptions differences. Described the benefits of using try-with-resources.
Stream API methods, mentioned terminal and intermediate methods, knows where to use. Knows about default methods in interfaces
Testing pyramid: named main levels
Bug reporting: provided an example of the defect with high priority and minor severity
Test Automation(UI): provided examples of using soft and hard assertions.
Test Automation(API): named HTTP status codes, methods, and listed ways to pass parameters in a request.
Described design patterns: Singleton pattern (driver), Factory pattern (browsers), Builder (rest object)
CI/CD: roughly described the role of the automation engineer in CI/CD process
Described TestNG annotations, DataProvider
SOLID: named description of dependency inversion principle, provided an example.
Code review: Named YAGNI KISS DRY, used SonarQube
VCS, git: knows what merge and rebase are for, how to update commit
What can be improved
Below are the topics which should be revised.
OOP - principles: inheritance, abstraction (described interfaces/polymorphism usage instead of an abstraction)
Java Fundamentals. Collections: Explore in detail collection realizations. Understand the key differences between ArrayList and LinkedList and their performance depending on usage. Map. Learn about equals/hashcode. Why equals/ hashcode methods should be overloaded, a dependency between them. What non-overridden equals will return for comparing custom objects, how hash-code is calculated.
Java Fundamentals. Generics: Their purpose and usage. Autoclosable resources.
Test Fundamentals: Testing types, Levels. Functional and non-functional testing. ROI.
Test Automation(API):  Study the typical structure of the API framework. How it can be organized in comparison with UI framework.
Test Automation Approaches: BDD vs DDT vs KDT. Which approach was used on the project (hybrid?)
CI/CD: Role of the automation engineer in the build process. CI/CD process best practices from dev to prod. Difference between Continuous integration/delivery/deployment.
Code review: Clean code principles, code conventions, anti-patterns, and refactoring techniques.
VCS: Git commands - rebase, cherry-pick, squash.

Recommended to study:
JUnit. Get familiar with TestNG vs JUnit4 vs JUnit5.
Estimation techniques
Gradle. Gradle vs Maven.
SQL: Get experience with more complex queries, setting up JDBC connections, and executing them using Java libraries.
Get experience with  BDD frameworks like Cucumber since BDD is added to the CV.

Reasoning for the selected recommendation
The session was productive and Alex did a good job preparing the artifacts for the session. Due to some reasons like stress or the language communication barrier part of the questions were not covered at the expected level. So we advise working on the gaps highlighted above which are specified as a requirement for middle specialists.
